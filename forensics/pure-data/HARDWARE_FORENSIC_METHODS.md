# Hardware-Level Android Debugging and Forensic Methods

## ⚠️ PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY

**WARNING**: These methods require advanced electronics knowledge, specialized equipment, and professional training. Improper use can permanently damage devices.

## Overview

Hardware-level debugging methods bypass software security measures by directly accessing device hardware interfaces. These techniques are used in professional forensic laboratories and require significant expertise.

**Procedure**:
```
1. Disassemble device carefully
2. Locate UART test points (usually labeled TX, RX, GND)
3. Identify voltage levels (typically 1.8V or 3.3V)
4. Connect UART adapter with appropriate voltage levels
5. Use terminal software (minicom, PuTTY, etc.)
6. Common baud rates: 115200, 57600, 38400, 19200
```

**Common UART Commands**:
```bash
# Linux terminal connection
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
